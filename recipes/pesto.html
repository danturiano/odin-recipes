        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
        Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes.
        Drain and transfer into a large bowl.

        Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion;

        pepper until warmed through.
