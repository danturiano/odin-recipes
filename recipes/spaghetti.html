      Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical
      pasta.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta,
      spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with
      vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from
      durum-wheat semolina.
