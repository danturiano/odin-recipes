# odin-recipes

For this project, I will create a simple recipe webpage it will contain 3 different dish
the content will be its description, image, ingredients, and steps on how to cook it.

I was able the use basic HTML elements such as using list (ordered, unordered), links,
images. However, I need to improve on using git. Looking forward to creating more projects
